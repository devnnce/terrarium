# Terrarium
A repository for Terraria nostalgia

**THIS IS FOR THE MOBILE VERSION ONLY**; For the PC version, feel free to explore the depths of the internet.

## Usage
The files provided in this repository are the necessities to run an old Terraria version **(specifically 1.2.12785)**. These batch of files **may** also work on older version (**down** 12785), but pray tell if the game doesnt do any checksum checks.

## Installation
These are the 2 files you need;
- Terraria `1.2.12785`, with package name `com.and.games505.TerrariaPaid`
  - This means you will need to sacrifice you current install of Terraria. **Backup the current files from that folder first.**
  - **NOTE:** We're looking for `com.and.games505.TerrariaPaid`, **NOT** `com.and.games505.Terraria`. The other one is the 1.2 demo and will NOT probably guarantee you the full 1.2 experience. Double check your files before proceeding.
  - For legal reasons, i will **NOT** provide the APK. Find it yourself.
- the entire repository as a `.zip` file. (or git cloning it on your phone may also work)

### Screenshots

## Support
As of now, there is no official Discord server (by me obviously) to provide support for certain issues. Feel free to open an issue on the repo. server will be on works/TBA.

## Credis
- [a reddit post that i accidentally found](https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraria/comments/121dz12/is_there_any_way_to_play_terraria_12_mobile_again/) as an aspiration for this repo,
- re-logic dev team for making the most fire game, and
- my goofy ahh curiosity.
